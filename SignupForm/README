Your task is to implement a signup form. The requirements are the following:

• There are 4 required fields:
  - username (2-15 characters)
  - email (must be a valid email address of the form x@y.z and must not be
      tim@kamcord.com)
  - password (6-30 characters)
  - confirm password (must match password)

• There is exactly one button on the form, which reads "Sign Up" and is
  initially disabled.

• All fields must be valid before the signup button becomes enabled. The class
  The class KCAccountValidator is provided for you which handles all validation
  logic :), *with the exception of confirming that the two password fields
  match*, which you must validate in your implementation.

• All validation errors and successes must be presented to the user in a
  sensible way with the appropriate error message in the event of an error. 

• Our designer has has left the details the validation confirmation design
  unspecified. It is your task to implement a sensible design to convey validation
  success and failure information to the user.

• Once all fields are valid, tapping the "Sign Up" button must dismiss the
  login view controller to reveal a simple view with a label that says "Hello,
  <username>", where <username> is the username that was entered in the signup
  form.
